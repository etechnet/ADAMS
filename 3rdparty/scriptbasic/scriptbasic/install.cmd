REM
REM Run this command script to install ScriptBasic after it was compiled
REM from source. The installation directory is T:\ScriptBasic
REM
REM This installation is needed by the setup program pack.cmd to build
REM the compressed binary installation package using the files put into
REM that directory.
REM
REM This script only checks that the two version of the compilers supported
REM and calls the basic program install.sb to do the work.
