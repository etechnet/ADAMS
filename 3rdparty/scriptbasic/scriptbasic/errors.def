#
# This file contains the error constants that are used in the ScriptBasic interpreter.
# The Perl program generrh.pl creates the files:
#
#     o errcodes.c   (errcodes.h is created from this file via headerer.pl)
#     o error.bas    (in the directory "include")
#
# %RT means run-time errors. Only these are put into the BASIC include file.
# %CT means compile-time errors. These are not present in the BASIC include file
#
# %MODULE names the actual module
#
# Each non-empty line should contain the error ID or the text for it.
# The error ID will be used to create the C #define constant as well as the BASIC
# Const constant.
#
# If you have the ID XXX_YYY_ZZZ in the module MMM then the C #define name will be
#
#        MMM_ERROR_XXX_YYY_ZZZ
#
# The BASIC Const will be
#
#       sbErrorXxxYyyZzz
#
# unless you define an alternative error constant name for the BASIC include file, for example:
#
#    MODTIME_FAIL SetModifyTime
#
# If you look at the definition of this error the BASIC symbolic ID is following the C #define
# symbolic name ID separated by space. If this is not defined the BASIC include ID is
# automatically calculated.
#
# Note that the constant MODULE_ERROR_SUCCESS and MODULE_ERROR_MEMORY_LOW are automatically
# generated. Also note that MODULE_ERROR_SUCCESS is guaranteed to be ZERO and all other
# errors are NOT zero. Also guaranteed that ALLMODULES_ERROR_MEMORY_LOW are equal.
