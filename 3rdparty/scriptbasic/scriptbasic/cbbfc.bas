' Convert Basic Binary Format Command
'
' This program reads a ScriptBasic binary format file
' and replaces the leading interpreter specification
' by the one specified by the user.
'
' For example a program was developed on a machine having
' scriba in the directory /usr/bin. The first line of the
' bbf file is then #!/usr/bin/scriba
' To run this bbf file without having the original source file
' on a machine having scriba on /usr/local/bin this first line
' has to be replaced. This is not a simple task, because
' the bbf file is binary
