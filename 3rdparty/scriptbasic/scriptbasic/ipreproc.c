/*POD
=section Process

This function is used by ScriptBasic at certain points of the execution to
start the preprocessors. It calls each loaded preprocessor one after the
other until there is no more preprocessors or one of them alters the command
variable to T<PreprocessorDone>.

This function gets three arguments.

T<lCommand> is the command for the preprocessor to execute. For the possible
values look at the file T<prepext.h> (created from T<prepext.c>)
T<enum PreprocessorCommands>

T<pPointer> is a pointer to a structure. The structure actually depends on the
actual value of T<lCommand>. For different commands this pointer points to different
structures.

When the preprocessors are called they can alter the T<long> variable T<lCommand>
passed to them by reference.

When a preprocessor in this variable returns the value T<PreprocessorDone> the
preprocessing in the actual stage is stopped and no further proreprocessor
is invoked. However this has no effect on later preprocessor incocation.
Returning this value in this variable solely means that the preprocessor
has done all work that has to be done at the very point and thus there is
no need of further preprocessor handling.

When a preprocessor in this variable returns the value T<PreprocessorUnload>
the function unhooks the preprocessor from the list af active preprocessors,
releases all memory that the preprocessor used up and frees the library.

The return value of the preprocessor functions should be zero or error code.

The return value of the function T<ipreproc_Process> is zero or the error value of
a preprocessor. If a preprocessor returns a non-zero error code no further
preprocessors are invoked.

This function can not be used in situation when the preprocessors may return
other value in T<lCommand> than T<PreprocessorDone> or T<PreprocessorContinue>.
