<h1>ScriptBasic Online Survey</h1>

"I do not want to fill in any survey! I want to <a href="http://scriptbasic.com/html/download.html">download</a>!"
Go ahead if you are in a hurry.
<P>
<a href="http://scriptbasic.com/html/download.html">I have already filled this form!</a>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="1">
Please devote some time to take this survey before you download the ScriptBasic
package of your desire. Filling this form will help the developers to gain
information on the use of ScriptBasic and to align the development directions
with needs. (Blah blah... I want to know what you do with my stuff so I can
develop it the way you need it.)
<p>
You can fill in the form with your name or anonymously.
You may answer all the questions or only some of the questions.
You can totally skip the survey and proceed to the
<a href="http://scriptbasic.com/html/download.html">download</a> page.
My only strong request is that you do not, please cannibalize the survey:
fill in once only and with real data.
<p>
The data you enter including any personal data is stored on the ScriptBasic.com
web site and on offline sites for later processing. The data will not ever be
disclosed to any third party except anonimized or aggregated, statistical data.
In case of any information disclose we will pay careful attention so that the
disclosed data should not be directly or indirectly be connected to the person
filling the form. We do not store the IP number or any other network information
collected from the act of somebody filling the form together with the data
entered.

you may fill in the survey anonymous, but it is polite to introduce yourself
Please fill in this fill so that I know who the answers belong to. This is not a

ourselves with names. Generally: this a polite act to introduce
yourself when you enter a place before you start to talk.

This field should contain your eMail address. Specifying your eMail here will
be used in non-autmated human mailing in case your data provided in the survey
is interesting and we want to ask you something. Specifying here the eMail

ScriptBasic mailing list if you have not done so), will not appear on any web
site.

Why do you use ScriptBasic (you should use anyway!)
why
think of the reasons and type it here
This is the hardest question to answer but also this can be the most valueable
in this survey. Why do you use ScriptBasic to sove your programming tasks
instead of Java, PHP, Perl, Python, Rexx, C or some other language? (I do not
mean that you should use any of those instead, and I also do not mean that you
should not!) What do you use ScriptBasic for? What are the tasks that you solve
using ScriptBasic?
<P>
If you did not use ScriptBasic up to now, then leave this field blank.
