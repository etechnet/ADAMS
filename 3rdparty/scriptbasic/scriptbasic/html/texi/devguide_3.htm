ScriptBasic was designed from the very start to be embeddable. This means that C programmers having their own application can fairly easy compile and link ScriptBasic together with their application and have ScriptBasic as a built in scripting language in their application.
<P>
To do this the C programmer should use the C api implemented in the file `<font size="3"><tt>scriba.c</tt></font>'. In this chapter we detail the C API as a reference listing all callable function, but before that there are some sections that describe a bit the overall model of ScriptBasiC. The next section will talk about what object orientation means for ScriptBasic and how to follow this object oriented approach when programming a ScriptBasic extended application in C.<HR>
