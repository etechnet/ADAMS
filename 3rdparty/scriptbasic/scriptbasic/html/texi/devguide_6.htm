ScriptBasic is written in C and thus there is a need for some C compiler to successfully install it from source. However some of the code is not maintained in C but rather in some higher level language (what an exaggeration!), which is compiled to C. To compile all the code from source you also need a functional Perl interpreter executing the version 5 of the language Perl.
<P>
Compilation is automated as much as it is possible and was highly tested on Windows NT and under Linux (Debian). Under other operating systems resembling to UNIX the compilation should be quite straight forward though may not be so seamless as it is for the ones I tested.<HR>
