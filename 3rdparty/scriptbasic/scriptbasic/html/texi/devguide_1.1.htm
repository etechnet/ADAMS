This documentation has four main chapters. These are
<P>
<UL>
<P>
<LI> <a href="devguide_2.htm">Interpreter Architecture</A> describes the overall architecture of the interpreter, lists the different modules, and contains the reference documentation of the C functions implemented in the individual modules.
<P>
<LI> <a href="devguide_3.htm">Embedding the Interpreter</A> describes how to write an application that embeds The ScriptBasic interpreter. This chapter also contains the reference documentation of the full C API.
<P>
<LI> <a href="devguide_4.htm">Extension Modules</A> describes what extension modules are, how to use them and how to write extension modules that may provide access to special programs, operating system features, and are not implemented in the interpreter core.
<P>
<LI> <a href="devguide_5.htm">Preprocessors</A> detail how to write preprocessor extensions to ScriptBasic. These extensions provide development functionalities like debugging, profiling and processing of the source code in addition to the processing of the interpreter.
<P>
<LI> <a href="devguide_6.htm">Compilation</A> details how to compile ScriptBasic under Windows NT.
</UL>
<P>
I advise you to read the architecture chapter first to get the overall picture. After that you can read one of the three middle chapters based on your plans. If you plan to embed the interpreter, read the second chapter. If you want to write an extension module, read the third chapter. If you intend to write a preprocessor, read the fourth chapter. You may want to do more than one even.
<P>
By now you may not need what the differences are. This will change after reading the architecture chapter.
<P>
The last chapter is to be read just before you start to experiment with ScriptBasic. This will give you guide lines how to compile the program from source. This may not be needed for extension module and preprocessor developers, but it does not do any harm either. It may help.<HR>
