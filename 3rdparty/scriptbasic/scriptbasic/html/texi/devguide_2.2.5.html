This function is called from <a href="devguide_2.2.3.html">reader_ReadLines()</A> after calling <a href="devguide_2.2.4.html">reader_ReadLines_r()</A>.
<P>
This function goes through all the lines and checks if there is any line
containing an include directive.
<P>
An include directive is a line starting with a word INCLUDE (case insensitive) and
is followed by the file name. The file name can be enclodes between double quotes.
<P>
Note that the processing of the include directives are done on the characters on the
line, because they are processed before any tokenization of the lexer module. This
can cause some problem only when there is an include like line inside a multiline string.
For example:
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="BLUE"><PRE>
a = """Hey this is a multiline string
include "subfile.txt"
"""
</PRE></FONT>
<P>
This <B>will</B> include the file <font size="3"><tt>subfile.txt</tt></font> and its content will become part of the string.
This becomes more complicated when the file <font size="3"><tt>subfile.txt</tt></font> contains strings.
<P>
The file name may not be enclosed between double quotes. In this case the file is tried to be
found in predefined system directories.
<P>
If the programmer uses the command IMPORT instead of INCLUDE the file will only be included if
it was not included yet into the current program.

  )@{
</PRE></FONT>
<P>
The file read is inserted into the plce where the include statement was.<HR>
