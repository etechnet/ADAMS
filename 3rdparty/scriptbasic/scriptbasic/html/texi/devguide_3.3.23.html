Initialize the Support Function Table of a process level ScriptBasic program object to be inherited
by other program objects. If you read it first time, read on until you understand what this
function really does and rather how to use it!
<P>
This is going to be a bit long, but you better read it along with the documentation of the
function <a href="devguide_3.3.24.html">scriba_InheritModuleInterface()</A>.
<P>
This function is needed only for programs that are
<UL>
<LI> multi thread running several interpreters simultaneous in a single process
<LI> support modules like the sample module <font size="3"><tt>mt</tt></font> that support multithread behaviour and
      need to implement worker thread needing call-back functions.
@end itemize
<P>
You most probably know that modules can access system and ScriptBasic fucntions via a
call-back table. That is a huge <font size="3"><tt>struct</tt></font> containing pointers to the functions that
ScriptBasic implements. This is the <font size="3"><tt>ST</tt></font> (aka support table).
<P>
This helps module writers to write system independent
code as well as to access ScriptBasic functions easily. On the other hand modules are
also free to alter this table and because many functions, tough not all are called via this
table by ScriptBasic itself a module may alter the core behavior of ScriptBasic.
<P>
For this reason each interpreter has its own copy of <font size="3"><tt>ST</tt></font>.
This means that if an interpreter alters the table it has no effect on another interpreter
running in the same process in anther thread.
<P>
This is fine so far. How about modules that run asynchronous threads? For example the very first
interpter thread that uses the module <font size="3"><tt>mt</tt></font> starts in the initialization a thread that later 
deletes all sessions that time out. This thread lives a long life.
<P>
The thread that starts the worker thread is an interpreter thread and has its own copy of the <font size="3"><tt>ST</tt></font>.
The thread started asynchronous however should not use this <font size="3"><tt>ST</tt></font> because the table is purged 
from memory when the interpreter instance it blelonged to finishes.
<P>
To have <font size="3"><tt>ST</tt></font> for worker threads there is a need for a program object that is not purged
from memory so long as long the process is alive. Fortunately there is such an object: the
configuration program object. Configuration is usually read only once by multi-thread implementations
and the same configuration information is shared by the serveral threads. The same way the
several program objects may share a <font size="3"><tt>ST</tt></font>.
<P>
The difference is that configuration is NOT altered by the interpreter or by any module in any way
but <font size="3"><tt>ST</tt></font> may. Thus each  execution object has two pointers: <font size="3"><tt>pST</tt></font> and <font size="3"><tt>pSTI</tt></font>. While <font size="3"><tt>pST</tt></font> points to
the support table that belongs to the interpreter instance the secondpointer <font size="3"><tt>pSTI</tt></font> points to
a <font size="3"><tt>ST</tt></font> that is global for the whole process and is permanent. This <font size="3"><tt>ST</tt></font> is to be used by worker threads
and should not be altered by the module without really good reason.
<P>
Thus: Don't call this function for normal program objects! For usualy program objects module
interface is automatically initialized when the first module function is called. Call this function
to initialize a <font size="3"><tt>ST</tt></font> for a pseudo program object that is never executed but rather used to inherit this
<font size="3"><tt>ST</tt></font> for worker threads.
