@c Modify a joker set
<P>
This function can be used to modify a joker set. The first argument <font size="3"><tt>pMS</tt></font> points to the
joker set collection. The second argument <font size="3"><tt>JokerCharacter</tt></font> specifies the joker character
for which the set has to be modified.
<P>
The argument <font size="3"><tt>nChars</tt></font> and <font size="3"><tt>pch</tt></font> give the characters that are to be modified in the set.
<font size="3"><tt>nChars</tt></font> is the number of characters in the character array pointed by <font size="3"><tt>pch</tt></font>.
<P>
The last argument <font size="3"><tt>fAction</tt></font> specifies what to do. The following constants can be used in
logical OR.
<P>

TO_HEADER:

#define MATCH_ADDC 0x0001 //add characters to the set
#define MATCH_REMC 0x0002 //remove characters from the set
#define MATCH_INVC 0x0004 //invert the character
#define MATCH_SNOJ 0x0008 //set becomes no-joker
#define MATCH_SSIJ 0x0010 //set becomes single joker

#define MATCH_FULS 0x0080 //fullify the set

The function first checks if it has to modify the state of the joker character. If
any of the bits <font size="3"><tt>MATCH_SNOJ</tt></font>, <font size="3"><tt>MATCH_SSIJ</tt></font> or <font size="3"><tt>MATCH_SMUJ</tt></font> is set in the field
<font size="3"><tt>fAction</tt></font> the type of the set is modified.
<P>
If more than one bit of these is set then result is undefined. Current implementation
checks these bits in a specific order, but later versions may change.
<P>
If the bit <font size="3"><tt>MATCH_NULS</tt></font> is set all the characters are removed from the set. If
the bit <font size="3"><tt>MATCH_FULS</tt></font> is set all characters are put into the set.
<P>
If more than one bit of these is set then result is undefined. Current implementation
checks these bits in a specific order, but later versions may change.
<P>
<font size="3"><tt>MATCH_NULS</tt></font> or <font size="3"><tt>MATCH_FULS</tt></font> can be used in a single call to initialize the set before
adding or removing the specific characters.
<P>
The bits <font size="3"><tt>MATCH_ADDC</tt></font>, <font size="3"><tt>MATCH_REMC</tt></font> and <font size="3"><tt>MATCH_INVC</tt></font> can be used to add characters to the set,
remove characters from the set or to invert character membership. The characters are taken
from the character array pointed by the function argument <font size="3"><tt>pch</tt></font>.
<P>
If more than one bit of these is set then result is undefined. Current implementation
checks these bits in a specific order, but later versions may change.
<P>
If none of these bits is set the value of the pointer <font size="3"><tt>pch</tt></font> is ignored.
<P>
It is no problem if a character is already in the set and is added or if it is not member of the set
and is removed. Although it has no practical importance the array pointed by <font size="3"><tt>pch</tt></font> may contain a
character many times.
