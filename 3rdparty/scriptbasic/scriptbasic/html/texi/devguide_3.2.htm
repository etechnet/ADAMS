The best way of learning is learning by example. Therefore here we will discuss the most obvious embedding application: the command line variation of ScriptBasic. The command line variation of ScriptBasic can be found in the file `<font size="3"><tt>scribacmd.c</tt></font>' in the source directory `<font size="3"><tt>variations/standard</tt></font>'. You may also find there a file named `<font size="3"><tt>basiccmd.c</tt></font>' that contains the code that was used before the <font size="3"><tt>scriba_</tt></font> C API was introduced. Have a look at it and bless God you have the new API.
<P>
In this section we will present the code from the file, but for brevity some code will not be copied to here. Also note that the code is copied and as the program develops the actual code may change while the one copied here most probably remains the same. (The API definitions are not "hand" copied, but rather taken from the C file when the documentation is compiled, so whenever the API changes the new documentation recompiled reflects the change.)<HR>
