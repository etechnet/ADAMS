@chapter Introduction

@chapter Application Form

In this application is an abstract entity. Forms contain title, which is a textual definition about what the form is, and forms have several fields containing textual value.

Forms can be used for several purposes. You can open a directory of forms to collect applicants for an event. The forms in such a directory can contain the name of the applicants, address and so on.

Forms are ordered into a tree hierarchical structure. It means that all but the root form has a parent form. This way a form directory is a special form that nothing but description, title and other forms having this one as parent.
