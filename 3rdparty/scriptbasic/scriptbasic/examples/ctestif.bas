' This basic program creates another BASIC program to test the IF/ELSEIF/ELSE
' construction executions. This program creates a program that has
' several IF ELSEIF ELSE ENDIF constructs with all possible true/false
' conditions orders. The generated program should NOT write out any "FAILED"
' and should print several OKs
' Finally the the two numbers should match the constants printed counting the printed
' OKs ensuring that all OKs were printed and counting the hopefully zero FAILED prints.
'

'
' You can change this, but increasing it 
' exponentially increases the size of the
' generated program
