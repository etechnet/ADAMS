HOW TO COMPILE THIS MODULE UNDER WINDOWS USING VISUAL C++

To compile this module you should have the zlibs.lib library installed in the
development environment. To achieve that download the ZLIB source code. Unfortunately
there is no official binary distribution of zlib. On the other hand it is 
very easy to compile the library frm source code.

The download of the library can be from the page:

                           http://www.gzip.org/zlib/

The version of zlib last time, when I wrote (February 16, 2005) this note
was 1.2.1 November 17, 2005. Thus zlib is quite stable and changes rarely.
This note may, however not be appropriate for other versions of the library.

Extract the source into a directory (C:\ZLIB)

Open a command prompt and CD into C:\ZLIB. Edit the file C:\ZLIB\WIN32\MAKEFILE.MSC

Edit the compiler options from

CFLAGS  = -nologo -MD -O2 $(LOC)

to

CFLAGS  = -nologo -MT -O2 $(LOC)

This is needed because all ScriptBasic modules are linked with the multi-thread C
run-time. Save the file and type:

nmake -f WIN32\MAKEFILE.MSC

After the library was compiled copy the header files (*.h) to the Visual C++ compiler
include directory and the library zlibs.lib to the Visual C++ compiler library directory.

copy *.h "D:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET\Vc7\include"
copy zlibs.lib "D:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET\Vc7\lib"

After this you can compile this module using the ScriptBasic development command

setup --module=zlib
