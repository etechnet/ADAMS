/*POD

This file implements resource pool handling routines. This helps multi-thread programs
to maintain a pool of resources. If it makes you problem to think about a resource as
an abstract entity then replace in your mind to database connection. This is especially
true because the very first version of this program is developed to help multi-thread
variation of ScriptBasic to efficiently handle DB connections to MySQL, PostgreSQL and
ORACLE. (Well, at the time we only have MySQL, but we plan the future.)

In an abstract way a resource is something that has to be opened, used and closed. Opening
a resource give a handle to a resource in the form of a pointer. This pointer is used to
reference this resource whenever it is used or is closed.

The resource pool (RP) contains resources. The resource pool manager (RPM) manages the pool.

The RPM has opened resources. Whenever a thread needs a resource it retrieves one from
the RP calling RPM function. When the thread does not need the resource anymore if passes 
it back to the RPM.

Between getting the resource and passing it back the thread uses the resource. We say
that the thread burns the resource. When a resource is used a lot it is burnt. The RPM
keeps track of the burn level of the resources and when a
resource is burnt out it is closed it and removed from the pool.

To keep track the burn level of the resource the thread using it can call the 
RPM burning function telling that the actual resource was used.

Assume the following example:

The resource is a database connection. There is a server process in the database for each connection.
The server is bugous and looses memory. You experience that a database connection used a lot of times
causes huge memory eating processes on the DB server. Thus you decide that the DB connection should not
be used more than a 100 queries.

The RPM also counts the number of times a resource was passed to a thread.
If this number reaches a limit the RPM removes the resource from the pool.

There is a third way of aging a resource. The RPM keeps track of the absolute age of the resource.
If this age reaches a limit the resource is closed.

A resource is never closed while used by a thread.

If there is any module that uses this module the module T<myalloc.c> has to be compiled in multi-threaded
mode defining T<-DMTHREAD=1> when compiling.

=H rpm_open

This function is called by the R<rpm_thread> function to open a new resource. This function is
started as a separate thread. This allocates memory to store a new resource, calls the resource
opening function pointed by the function pointer T<fpOpen> and intializes the resource. This
means setting the burn level, use level to zero and the resource create time to the current time.

When the resource is ready the function locks the resource pool and links the resource into the
free list. While linking the resource into the free list the function decrements the field T<nOpening>
and increments the field T<nFree> as the resource is not in the opening state anymore but free and available for
use.

The arguments:

=itemize
=item T<pSt> should point to the ScriptBasic support function table. This is needed to call the functions available
in the ScriptBasic core code and callable by the extensions.

=item T<lMaxBurn> the maximum number of burn value that a resource can get. When a resource is used the thread
using it may call the burning function to increase the burn level of the resource. If the burn level
gets higher than this limit the resource is not used anymore and is closed by the RPM when the thread
passes it back to the RPM. If this value is zero then burn values are not calculated.

=item T<lMaxTime> the maximum number of seconds (or other time base) that a resource can be used. When a resource
gets older than this value it is not given to a thread anymore but closed by the RPM. If this value is zero any
age of resource is used. The time is calculated calling the function T<timefun> which may not return the actual
time but any value that is appropriate to age resources.

=item T<lMaxUse> the maximum number of times a resource is passed to a thread. When a resource is passed to a thread
an internal counter is increased. When the counter reaches this limit the resource is not used any more but
closed. If this limit is zero a reasource can be passed to threads any times.

=item T<lMinFree> this argument gives the number of free resources that the RPM tries to keep available. When the number
of resources gets lower than this the RPM starts to allocate more free resources smaking them available by the
time when a thread asks for it. This value should be positive.

=item T<lMaxFree> this argument gives the number of free resources that the RPM keeps at most. If the number of free
resources gets higher than this number the RPM starts to close some resources. This value should be no smaller
than T<lMinFree>.

=item T<lWaitSleep> should specify the time in seconds to sleep when a thread waits for something. This is the
interval the R<rpm_ager> sleeps between checking that there are ages resources and this is the interval the resource
allocator sleeps waiting for free resource when there is no available free resource.

=item T<pool> is a pointer to a resource type handle. This pointer is not used by the RPM but is passed to the
T<pfOpen()>, T<fpClose()> and T<timefun> functions.

=item T<fpOpen> pointer to a function that opens a resource. This function should accept a T<void *> pointer. Ther
RPM will pass the T<pool> to this pointer. The function should return the handle T<void *> pointer to the resource
or T<NULL> if the resource is not openable.

=item T<fpClose> pointer to a function that closes a resource. This function shoudl accept two T<void *> pointer arguments.
The first one is the T<pool> pointer, the second is the pointer that was passed back by the function T<fpOpen>.

=item T<myalloc> function to a T<malloc> like function. If this argument is T<NULL> then T<malloc> is used.

=item T<myfree> function to a T<free> like function. If this argument is T<NULL> then T<free> is used.

=item T<timefun> function to a function that returns the actual time in terms of resource age. 
This can be the number of seconds since the epoch, like returned by the system function T<time()> or
some other increasing value that correspnds with resource age. The function should accept a T<void *> pointer
as argument. The RPM passes the pointer T<pool> in this argument. If this argument is T<NULL> then the
system function T<time()> is used.

=noitemize

Return value is a pointer to the new pool or T<NULL> if there is memory allocation error or if the arguments
are erroneous.
