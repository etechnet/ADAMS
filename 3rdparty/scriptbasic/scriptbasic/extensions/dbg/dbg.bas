REM """
This is dbg.bas

This file is copied into the module header files directory.
dbg.dll or dbg.so is not a module. It is a preprocessor
that helps the programmer to debug. There is no need to 
include any header file to use a preprocessor.

However the stupid installer thinks that this 'module' was not
compiled properly if there is no header file. Therefore here
this file is here as a placeholder. Do not use it!

Actually I wrote the stupid installer and I decided that it is
better to have a dummy header file for each preprocessor than
recognizing a module properly installed when the header file
is actually corrupt or missing.
