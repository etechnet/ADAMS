' The argument is the name of the module. This is

' module header BAS file.

'
' Note that here you can use module functions as
' the module is already installed when the code
' gets here. However the functions you use should
' be either declared here or the header file has
' to be included from the original location.
' In other words you have to
'
' include "module.bas"
'
' with the quotes to include the file from the actual
' directory. This is because the 'include' is processed
' when the interpreter reads the program before it 
' starts and by that time the header file is not installed
' yet.

' If there is any operation that the installing
' person has to manually perform then print the message
