The core code of the CGI handling routines was not written just looking at the RFC. I have learned a lot 
from other works. The most important to mention is the CGI.pm Perl module written by Lincoln D. Stein 
(http://www-genome.wi.mit.edu/ftp/pub/software/WWW/cgi_docs.html) Another work was named 
cgi-lib.c created by eekim@eekim.com. This piece of code gave me the last push to finish looking for 
readily available free library to interface with ScriptBasic and write instead a new one.
<P>
The ISAPI interface was developed using the Microsoft Developer Network CD documentation and I really 
learned a lot while testing the different uses of the function ReadClient until I could figure out that the 
official Microsoft documentation is wrong.
<P>
It says: "If more than lpdwSize bytes are immediately available to be read, ReadClient will block until some amount 
of data has been returned, and will return with less than the requested amount of data." In fact it has to be "If less 
than lpdwSize bytes are immediately available to be read, ReadClient will block until some amount of data has been 
returned, and will return with possibly less than the requested amount of data."<HR>
