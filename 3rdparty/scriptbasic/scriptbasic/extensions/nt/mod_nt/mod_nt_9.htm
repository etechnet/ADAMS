<P>

This procedure gathers the information on the actually executiong processes and returns
the information in an array.
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="BLUE"><PRE>
nt::ListProcesses PS
</PRE></FONT>
<P>
The result is stored in the variable <font size="3"><tt>PS</tt></font>. This will be an array, with each element being also an
array holding information for the process. The number of running processes can be determined
using <font size="3"><tt>ubound(PS)+1</tt></font>.
<P>
The elements of the array is indexed from 0 to 8 contaiing the following elements:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> 0 Number of references to the process. A process exists as long as its usage count is nonzero. As soon as its usage count becomes zero, a process terminates.
<LI> 1 Identifier of the process. The contents of this member can be used by Win32 API elements.
<LI> 2 Identifier of the default heap for the process. The contents of this member has meaning only to the tool help functions. It is not a handle, nor is it usable by Win32 API elements.
<LI> 3 Module identifier of the process. The contents of this member has meaning only to the tool help functions. It is not a handle, nor is it usable by Win32 API elements.
<LI> 4 Number of execution threads started by the process.
<LI> 5 Identifier of the process that created the process being examined. The contents of this member can be used by Win32 API elements.
<LI> 6 Base priority of any threads created by this process. 
<LI> 7 Reserved; do not use.
<LI> 8 Path and filename of the executable file for the process.
