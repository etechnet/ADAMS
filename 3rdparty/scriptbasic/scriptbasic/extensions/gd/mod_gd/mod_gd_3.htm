The module comes in source form or as compiled binary. Binary is usually available for the Win32 platforms only. The compilation of the source code is simple. Compile the source files to a .dll or to .so shared library. When installing the standard ScriptBasic package the make file does not create nor installs this module. You have to go into the directory of the extension, usually
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="BLUE"><PRE>
/home/user/scriba/extensions/dg
</PRE></FONT>
<P>
and you should run the script install.sh typing:
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="BLUE"><PRE>
# sh install.sh
</PRE></FONT>
<P>
Note that you have to run the script with root privileges to be able to copy the resulting gd.so file to its final location. To successfully install this module you have to have the modules, gd, png and z installed.
<P>
The compiled module contains a dynamically load binary file and a basic include file named gd.bas. The include file gd.bas should be placed in a module include directory file configured in the configuration file. The configuration file usually named scriba.conf should include a line
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="BLUE"><PRE>
include /etc/scriba/include/
</PRE></FONT>
<P>
defining the include files location for the modules and other generally used include files. The actual directory can be different.
<P>
The binary part of the module should be placed in another directory specified in the configuration file, like
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="BLUE"><PRE>
module /usr/scriba/lib/
</PRE></FONT>
<P>
There can be more than one include and module statement in the configuration file. In that case the interpreter searches the directories in the order they are specified until the include file or the module is found.<HR>
