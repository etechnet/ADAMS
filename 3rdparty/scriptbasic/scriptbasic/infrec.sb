REM This program checks the depth of the interpreter process stack
REM to determine the safe configuration setting for ScriptBasic
REM value 'maxlevel'
REM
REM This program will call the subroutine RECURSE infinitely until
REM segmentation fault occures. In each call it prints a dot into
REM the file 'depth.txt'. When the program dies the length of the
REM file can be used to determine the maximal deepness of the stack
REM that this compilation of ScriptBasic can handle.
