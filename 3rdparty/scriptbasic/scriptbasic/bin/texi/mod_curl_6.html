You can call this function to close the connection that was used by CURL and to release
all resources that were allocated to handle the connection. To call this function is not
a must as all the releasing tasks are automatically performed as soon as the interpreter
finishes execution the BASIC program. However it is a good practice to call this functions
especially if you want to access the file the perform routine downloaded.

Usage:

This function closes the connection to the remote URL, closes the local file (if there was opened any), and
releases the memory that was used for the connection.<HR>
