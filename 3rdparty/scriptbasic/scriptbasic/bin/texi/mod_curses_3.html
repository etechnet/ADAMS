The distribution contains the C language source file and the ScriptBasic
include file. The C source must be compiled with the following command:
<P>
<FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="BLUE"><PRE>
cc -shared -o libcurses.so curses.c -lcurses
</PRE></FONT>
<P>
The curses library and its include files (for Debian users: libncurses5 and
libncurses5-dev packages) must be installed.
<P>
Move the library to your ScriptBasic library directory and the include file
to the ScriptBasic include file directory (or redefine include and library
directories in basic.conf).
<P>
I hope that this module will be included in the ScriptBasic distribution
RSN.
<P>

My original plan was to port the CIO library to Unices, but most of its
functions could not be adapted and curses supports a much wider range
of screen operations than CIO, so this extension became a curses interface.
<P>
This means that curses routines are not compatible with CIO, although
it should be very easy to make a subset of CIO routines available under
Unices.
<P>
sbkbhit is the equivalent of getch(0, 0).
Console title modification is (of course) not supported, but something
could be done with xterm's title modification escape sequences.
<P>
NoBreak is not supported. ScriptBasic programs should be terminated with
Ctrl-C (SIGINT).
<P>
SizeX and SizeY are the equivalent of getmaxx and getmaxy.
<P>
Color support is VERY different in curses.
<P>
Cls is the direct equivalent of erase.
<P>
Naturally, the ncurses console cannot be resized like the SetWindow command
does it under Windows.
<P>

<P>
The only non-straightforward thing about the curses library is its
color support.
<P>
Every character on the screen has an associated color pair number. A
color pair consists of a background and a foreground color. There are a
a very finite number of available color pairs, which can be found out
using the maxcolors function.
<P>
If you want to print a character in a specified color, you initialize
a color pair to that color, and then make that the active color pair
using setcolor.
<P>
You cannot cheat (i.e. print more colors on the screen than the
number of available color pairs) by printing a character and then
changing its color pair's definition, because if a color pair is
changed, its occurrences on the screen are repainted using the new
color. This is quirk in curses (I think for the sake of being
compatible with some kind of old terminals).
<P>

<P>
This is VERY straightforward. Windows can be created and deleted using
newwin and delwin. Sub-window support is there in ncurses, but I chose
not to support that because the documentation of ncurses says that it
is still buggy.
<P>
Console handling low level routines for Unix ncurses environment.
<P>
This module implements interface routines to the ncurses library.<HR>
