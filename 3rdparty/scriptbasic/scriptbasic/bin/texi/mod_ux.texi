@chapter  Unix specific functions
This module implements some UNIX system calls that are not implemented 
in the core of ScriptBasic but can be helpful for those who want to write 
system maintenance scripts using ScriptBasic.

The reason that these functions are not implemented inside ScriptBasic 
is that ScriptBasic itself is portable, and whenever a programmer writes a 
program in pure ScriptBasic it should execute the same way under UNIX as well 
as under Windows NT/Win98/W2K.

Programs using the module ux however are UNIX specific and will 
not run unaltered under Windows NT.


@chapter  Fork the process

@example
pid = ux::fork()
if pid then
  print "The sub process pid is ",pid
else
  print "Oh I am the child process"
end if
@end example


@chapter  Change file access mode
@example
ux::chmod("file_name",mode)
@end example

This function implements the @code{chmod} UNIX system call.
