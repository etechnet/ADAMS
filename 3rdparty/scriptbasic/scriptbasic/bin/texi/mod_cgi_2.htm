Functions that handle web input data for the standalone module running as CGI or
ISAPI or Eszter SB Engine variation.

<P>
The module CGI is implemented as an external module written in the language C. Whenever the 
programmer wants to write a program using the language ScriptBasic that uses the CGI interface of the web 
server he or she can use this module. Although this is not a must to use this module for CGI programming 
it IS a wise choice. 
<P>
The module comes from the developers of the language interpreter. Most of its code is implemented as C 
code, executing fast and efficient. In its very first version of the module it already supports such 
advanced features as file upload in a robust and secure way. It handles cookies, POST and GET operations 
and will support other interfaces in the future like Apache Module interface or FastCGI in a compatible 
manner.
<P>
The basic programs using the ISAPI interpreter should use the module the same way as CGI versions. In 
other words if you write a CGI program it should work executed by the ISAPI version of the interpreter 
without modification.
